          a) An outcrop of the transition from the Wapiabi Formation to the Belly River Formation was studied in detail at Lundbreck Falls, Alberta. The observed vertical succession of sediments is as follows: 1) interbedded dark shales and Bouma B, BC and C type turbidites; 2) hummocky cross-stratified sandstones and bioturbated silts; 3) swaley cross-stratified sandstones; 4) parallel laminated sandstones; 5) mudstones interbedded with trough cross-stratified sandstone. The turbidites and hummocky cross-stratified sandstones are storm-generated density current deposits. The swaley cross-stratified sandstones have formed below parallel laminated beach deposits and above storm deposits. The section is capped by fluvial deposits containing evidence of subaerial exposure.
          Paleoflow directions in the lower portion of the section indicate that the regional paleoslope dipped northward. Density currents may have flowed down a topographically significant north-south trending trough. Net sediment transport in the shallow marine portion of the section was towards the east north-east.
          Petrographic studies indicate that the sandstones are similar to the "barren" basal Belly River sandstones of the Burmis area, studied by Mellon (1961).
          Another section consisting of continental elastics of the Blairmore Group was studied at Daisy Creek, Alberta. The lower part of the section contains interbedded grey mudstone and cross-stratified sandstone. These are erosively overlain by a 25 m thick, cross-stratified sandstone which caps the section. The sediments have been interpreted in terms of a meandering fluvial system.
